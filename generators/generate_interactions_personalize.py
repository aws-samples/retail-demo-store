"""
This script exists so that when developing or internal deployment of public commits
(to retail-demo-store-eu-west-1 and retail-demo-store-us-east-1 and retail-demo-store-us-west-2)
the new Personalize training files can be generated, picked up, and uploaded.

This script generates interactions for Amazon Personalize by heuristic simulation. It is based off the notebook
under workshop/01-Personalization where the logic is explained in more detail.
However, it has been improved in the following ways:
 1. This script is deterministic; random seeds from RANDOM_SEED random variable below.
 2. Logic exists for ensuring balance across categories.
 3. Logic exists for ensuring balance across products.
 4. Discount events are also generated according to 3 different types of users: discount-likers discount-indifferent,
    and price-sensitive-discount-likers.
Item 1 allows us to re-generate data during staging and item 2 and 3 helps recommendations look appropriate in
the final demo. If there is poor balance across products and categories then one may not get recommendations
for products in the same category. This is a hotfix for the logic whereby we generate profiles and probabilistically
sample product categories according to the sample user profile. Item 4 is necessary for training the discounts
personalizeation campaign.
