# User Data Generator

[generate_users_json.py](./generate_users_json.py) generates a set of users for the Retail Demo Store.

These user profiles are used in the following ways:

* The [Users service](../src/users) provides login services to the user profiles that this creates for the Retail Demo Store
* Workshops which need to generate simulated user behavior data can use the datagenerator library to create simulated events for these user profiles after they are created.  This provides realistic and consistent data across all integrated tools in the Retail Demo Store.

## datagenerator Library

The datagenerator library is a Python library that provides the following functions:

* A pool of randomly generated users see [./datagenerator/users.py](./datagenerator/users.py)
* The ability to specify a set of user behavior funnels and to then generate events that can be sent to Amazon Personalize, Segment, or Amplitude (see [./datagenerator/file.py](./datagenerator/file.py), [./datagenerator/amplitude.py](./datagenerator/amplitude.py), and [./datagenerator/segment.py](./datagenerator/segment.py)).

For a working example of the event generator features, see [3.5-Amplitude-Performance-Metrics.ipynb](../workshop/3-Experimentation/3.5-Amplitude-Performance-Metrics.ipynb)
