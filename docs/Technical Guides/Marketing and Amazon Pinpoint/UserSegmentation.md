Amazon Pinpoint enables organizations to create user segments - or groups of customers - based on their behavior
across web/mobile applications, interactions over email, text, push notifications, and other channels, or based on
stored data. This is important in retail environments because customers deliver valuable intent data across
in-store, e-commerce, and customer engagement channels. Pinpoint enables organizations to create a single event
bus of all these interactions to inform segmentation, personalized messaging, and analytics.



These segments can often be created and responded to in real-time. Here, your clickstreams in the Retail Demo
Store application are ingested by Amazon Pinpoint to create new user segments in real-time. These segments are
then used to deliver the targeted messages that receive throughout the demo.
