Amazon Pinpoint enables organizations to deliver messages across email, text, mobile push, voice, and custom
channels like messenger apps and retail apps. These messages can be augmented with data output from ML services
like Amazon Personalize for Personalization, Recommendations, Next-Best-Actions, among other use cases. User
attributes from Amazon Personalize can be selected within the Amazon Pinpoint console or API in order to
personalize the content of email templates in real-time. Importantly, this enables organizations to deliver a
unified, omni-channel personalization experience.



Here,

1. Pinpoint sends new users a welcome email after they sign up for a Retail Demo Store account. Check the email
entered during account creation and look for the Retail Demo Store welcome email. If you’d like to send the
email to a different email address, go to the Account settings page and enter the new one.
  
1. When Retail Demo Store users add items to their shopping cart but do not complete an order, Amazon Pinpoint
send an email with a coupon code encouraging them to finish their order. To see this feature, add a few items
to your shopping cart. In the shopping cart page, click on the button that says ”Trigger Abandoned Cart
email”. This action will emulate a signed out event and will trigger the abandoned cart email sent by Amazon
Pinpoint. Next, check the email account provided during account creation. The Abandoned Shopping Cart email will be in your
inbox.
