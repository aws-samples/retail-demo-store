The Retail Demo Store uses all [three supported dataset types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/how-it-works-dataset-schema.html)
for Amazon Personalize: users, items, and interactions. Additionally, an Amazon Personalize Event Tracker is
utilized to capture real-time events in the web user interface which populate the Personalize-managed event
interactions dataset. AWS Amplify is used to send events to the Retail Demo Storeâ€™s Personalize Event Tracker.

With the exception of the real-time event data which is created as a result of your browsing behavior in the web
user interface, the data in the users, items, and interactions datasets are composed of fictitious, or in the case
of interactions history, synthetically generated data.
