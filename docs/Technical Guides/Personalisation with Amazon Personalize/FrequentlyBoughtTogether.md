Amazon Personalize Recipe: [Frequently-Bought-Together](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/ECOMMERCE-use-cases.html#frequently-bought-together-use-case)

A common cross-selling technique on e-commerce sites is recommending items that other users have frequently bought together. The idea
is to encourage users to add more products to their shopping cart and thereby increasing average order value and the bottom line. Amazon
Personalize implements this use case with the Frequently Bought Together retail recommender. This recommender can be deployed as part of your
shopping cart or checkout views or when users add new items to their cart.
