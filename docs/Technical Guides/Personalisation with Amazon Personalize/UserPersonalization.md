Amazon Personalize Recipe:
[User-Personalization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/native-recipe-new-item-USER_PERSONALIZATION.html)



Product and content recommendations tailored to a user’s profile and habits are more likely to drive higher
conversion. Amazon Personalize helps tailor recommendations to users behavior, preferences, and history, boosting
their engagement and satisfaction in real-time, instead of providing a uniform experience. User personalization
also handles the “cold-start” challenge where limited or no historical information is known about an item or user.
User personalization in Amazon Personalize balances recommending fresh items with the most relevant based on a
user’s unique preferences and behaviors.



User personalization is implemented in the “Inspired by your shopping trends” section. Try using different
shoppers to experience the difference in personalized product recommendations offered.
