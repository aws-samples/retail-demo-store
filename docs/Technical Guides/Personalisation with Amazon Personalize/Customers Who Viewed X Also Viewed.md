# Customers Who Viewed X Also Viewed

[Official Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/ECOMMERCE-use-cases.html#customers-also-viewed-use-case)

Related item recommendations help users discover new products or compare existing items in your catalog. Amazon
Personalize recommends similar items in real-time, based on user behavior to create unique, relevant experiences
for your customers.

Pretty simple idea, implemented via item-item collaborative filtering but basically look at how people are
interacting with particular products and then determine how similar things are at a global level based on that data.
Not user specific at all.
