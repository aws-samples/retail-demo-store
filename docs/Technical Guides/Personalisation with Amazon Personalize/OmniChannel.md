By connecting Amazon Pinpoint with Amazon Personalize (or other ML services), organizations can take their
customers’ interactions across channels and feed them into their foundational Personalization models for
omni-channel ML model retraining.



This enables organizations to utilize all of their customers’ digital interactions within a centralized ML model
to get smarter, faster. This also enables organizations to deliver personalized experiences in an omni-channel
fashion, meaning the experiences are harmonized and responsive across their channels of engagement.
