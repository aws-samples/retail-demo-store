AWS partners have developed workshop content that enable you to learn how to integrate their solutions with the Retail Demo Store and the AWS services that it relies on, such as Amazon Personalize.

AWS Partner | Workshops Overview | Workshop Links | Level | Duration
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
![Amplitude logo](./assets/amplitude.svg) | In this workshop, you will set up tracking for [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) events, analyze user behavior prior to peronalization being deployed, and then measure the effects of personalization on user behavior after Personalize is deployed in the Retail Demo Store. | [Evaluating Personalization Performance](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/workshop/3-Experimentation/3.5-Amplitude-Performance-Metrics.ipynb) | 200 | 30 minutes
![Braze logo](./assets/braze.svg) | In this workshop we will use [Braze](https://www.braze.com/) to add the ability to personalize marketing messages to customers of the Retail Demo Store using customer behavioral data and the Personalize models you trained when setting up Amazon Personalize. | [Personalized Email Campaigns](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/workshop/4-Messaging/4.2-Braze.ipynb) | 200 | 1 hour
![mParticle logo](./assets/mparticle.svg) | [mParticle](https://mparticle.com/) is a Customer Data Platform that allows any brand to ingest data from multiple sources in real-time, apply data quality and governance over the ingested data and orchestrate the data to any marketing and technology stack your organization is using.  In this workshop, you will configure real-time event flows to Amazon Personalize using the mParticle SDKs and then use that data to create customer profiles that can be used in marketing campaigns to customers via Braze. | [Real Time Personalization Events](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/workshop/1-Personalization/Lab-6-Real-time-events-mParticle.ipynb) <br/><br/> [Personalized Customer Profiles and Messaging with any marketing tool (Braze) and mParticle](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/workshop/6-CustomerDataPlatforms/6.2-mParticle.ipynb) | 300 | 1-1.5 hours
![Optimizely logo](./assets/optimizely.svg) | In this exercise we will define, launch, and evaluate the results of an A/B experiment of a personalized user experience using [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/). | [AB Experiments for Personalization](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/workshop/3-Experimentation/3.6-Optimizely-AB-Experiment.ipynb) | 200 | 30 minutes
![Segment logo](./assets/segment.svg) | [Segment](https://segment.com/) is a real-time events pipeline for customer data, as well as a customer data platform.  In the Retail Demo Store, Segment is used to deliver real-time events from the web user interface to Amazon Personalize.  These real-time events are also used to create customer profile with Amazon Personalize recommendations appended, which can then be used via the CDP to push data to marketing tools. | [Real Time Personalization Events](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/workshop/1-Personalization/Lab-5-Real-time-events-Segment.ipynb) <br/><br/> [Customer Data Platforms and Personalize](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/workshop/6-CustomerDataPlatforms/6.1-Segment.ipynb) | 300 | 1-1.5 hours
![Layer0 logo](./assets/Layer0.svg) | :warning: **This demo is currently going through some fixes and is likely to not work** :warning: [Layer0](https://layer0.co/) extends the capabilities of a traditional CDN by not only hosting your static content, but also providing server-side rendering for progressive web applications. Layer0 allows caching both your APIs and HTML at the network edge to provide your users with the fastest browsing experience. Teams can ship faster leveraging an enhanced developer experience to deploy code faster and with more frequency, view their code quickly in atomically deployed environments, and integrating their CDN configuration to the overall build process. Layer0 provides the tools needed to build the modern apps capable of providing the performance expected by modern consumers.  | [Edge Optimization](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/workshop/8-PerformanceOptimization/8.1-Layer0.ipynb) | 200 | 1 hour
