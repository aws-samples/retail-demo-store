Description: >
  This template deploys the base Retail Demo Store project and workshop notebooks in Event Engine.
  MUST BE DEPLOYED IN THE SAME REGION AS THE ResourceBucket PARAMETER BELOW!

Parameters:
  ResourceBucket:
    Type: String
    Description: >
      S3 bucket name where the Retail Demo Store deployment resources are staged (product images, nested CloudFormation templates, source code snapshot,
      notebooks, deployment Lambda code, etc).
    # This is the Retail Demo Store project's standard staging bucket for deployments in us-east-1. The contents in this
    # bucket are always kept in sync with the latest from the upstream Retail Demo Store GH repo. If you want to deploy custom
    # coding changes, data files, custom nested CFN templates, or whatever for your workshop, you will need to stage ALL required
    # deployment resources to a public S3 bucket (or to the EEAssetsBucket for your EE module) and change the default value
    # below to match your bucket. The stage.sh script in the root of the Retail Demo Store repo can be used to stage these
    # resources. See the documentation in the GH repo for details. As noted above, the region of your staging bucket must
    # match the region where you're deploying your event in Event Engine.
    Default: 'retail-demo-store-us-east-1'

  ResourceBucketRelativePath:
    Type: String
    Description: >
      Optional path in the Deployment Resources Staging bucket where the deployment resources are stored (e.g. path/path2/).
      Leave blank if resources are at the root of the Staging Resource Bucket. If specified, MUST end with '/'.
    Default: ''

Resources:
  # This references the root template.yaml file that comes with the Retail Demo Store as a nested template. The parameters passed
  # to this template are set to sensible default values for a base Retail Demo Store workshop experience. If you want to run an
  # event with different template parameter values than these, create your own blueprint and module in Event Engine, use this
  # file/template as your team template, and adjust values as needed. Be sure to leave "CreateElasticsearchServiceLinkedRole" set
  # to "No" below and add "es.amazonaws.com" to the "IAM Service Linked Roles" in your Event Engine template so EE will conditionally
  # create this role for you. Happy Eventing.
  ee:   # Keep the resource name short to avoid name length issues in nested template resources
