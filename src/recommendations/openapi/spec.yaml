  title: Recommendations API
  version: v1
  description: |-
    The Recommendations web service provides a RESTful API for retrieving personalized product recommendations, related products, product reranking, and suggested discounts (powered by Amazon Personalize).

    The [Web UI](../../web-ui) makes calls to this service when a user is viewing the home view (recommended products), product detail view (related products), or the category view (personalized ranking of products). If Amazon Personalize campaigns have been created for these use-cases (either by the deployment Lambda option or by stepping through the [Personalization](../../../workshop/1-Personalization/Lab-01-(Core)-Introduction-and-data-preparation.ipynb) workshop), then those campaigns will be called by the Recommendations service. Otherwise, the service will call the [Products](../../products) service to provide a suitable default behavior such as displaying featured products or products from the same category as the displayed product.

    This service also provides support for running experiments for personalization approaches using techniques such as A/B testing, interleaving results testing, and multi-armed bandit testing. The [Experimentation](../../../workshop/3-Experimentation/3.1-Overview.ipynb) workshops are designed to walk you through how to setup, run, and evaluate experiments.

        Returns item/product recommendations for a given user in the context
        of a current item (e.g. the user is viewing a product and I want to provide
        recommendations for other products they may be interested in).

        If an experiment is currently active for this feature ('home_product_recs'),
        recommendations will be provided by the experiment. Otherwise, the default
        behavior will be used which will look to see if an Amazon Personalize
        campaign is available. If not, the Product service will be called to get
        products from the same category as the current product or featured products.

      description: |-
        Gets user ID, items list and feature and chooses which items to discount according to the
        reranking campaign. Gets a ranking with discount applied and without (using contextual metadata)
        and looks at the difference. The products are ordered according to how the response is expected
        to improve after applying discount.

        The items that are not chosen for discount will be returned as-is but with the "discounted" key set to False.
        The items that are chosen for discount will have the "discounted" key set to True.

        If there is an experiment active for this feature the request for ranking for choosing discounts will have been
        routed through the experiment resolver and discounts chosen according to whichever approach is active. The
        items will have experiment information recorded against them and if URLs were provided for products these will be
        suffixed with an experiment tracking correlation ID. That way, different approaches to discounting can be compared,
        as with different approaches to recommendations and reranking in other campaigns.

        Returns an offer recommendation for a given user.

        Hits the offers endpoint to find what offers are available, get their preferences for adjusting scores.
        Uses Amazon Personalize if available to score them.
        Returns the highest scoring offer.

        Experimentation is disabled because we are sending the offers through Pinpoint emails and for this
        demonstration we would need to add some more complexity to track those within the current framework.
        Pinpoint also has A/B experimentation built in which can be used.
