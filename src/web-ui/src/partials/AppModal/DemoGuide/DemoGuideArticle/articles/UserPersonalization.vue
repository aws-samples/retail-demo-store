    <p>
      Product and content recommendations tailored to a user’s profile and habits are more likely to drive higher
      conversion. Amazon Personalize helps tailor recommendations to users behavior, preferences, and history, boosting
      their engagement and satisfaction in real-time, instead of providing a uniform experience. User personalization
      also handles the “cold-start” challenge where limited or no historical information is known about an item or user.
      User personalization in Amazon Personalize balances recommending fresh items with the most relevant based on a
      user’s unique preferences and behaviors.

    <p>
      User personalization is implemented in the “Inspired by your shopping trends” section. Try using different
      shoppers to experience the difference in personalized product recommendations offered.
