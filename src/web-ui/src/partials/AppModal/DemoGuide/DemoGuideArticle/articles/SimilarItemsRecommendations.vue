    <p>
      Related item recommendations help users discover new products or compare existing items in your catalog. Amazon
      Personalize recommends related items in real-time, based on user behavior and thematically similar item attributes to create unique, relevant experiences
      for your customers.
    </p>

    <p>
      This user experinece is implemented using the Similar-Items algorithm that considers co-occurrence in interactions data (how often these items appear together across user histories)
      and thematic similarity (what is similar about the items in your catalog) when making recommendations to better quantify similarity for less popular or new items in
      your catalog. The product detail page in this demo takes it a step further by using the Personalized-Ranking recipe to rerank related items recommendations for each user. This adds a level of
      personalization to the user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can read more about the Similar-Items recipe on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-personalize-can-now-unlock-intrinsic-signals-in-your-catalog-to-recommend-similar-items/">Amazon Personalize blog</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="similar-item-recommendations">
      The similar item recommendations use case is implemented in all the product detail pages under the “Compare similar items”
      carousel widget. The order of items is personalized to each user by leveraging the Personalized-Ranking recipe to reorder
      related items based on the current user's interest.

            potency of integrating ML into all facets of the company. Our success led to key decision-makers requesting
            we integrate Amazon Personalize into more of the StockX experience and expand our ML endeavors. It’s safe to
