    <p>
      <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/location/">Amazon Location Services</a>
      is an Amazon provision of maps, location indexing, geofencing, user tracking, and routing.
      Geofencing can be used to
      set off chains of events just when they need to be set off
      - when your customer is in the right place, at the right time.
      In this demo we use it together with the ecommerce platform and Amazon Pinpoint
      to engage customers when they approach physical stores.
    </p>

    <p>
      Customers are inspired to opt in to share their location by being
      provided with personalized offers. These offers can be related to
      customer preferences, local stock levels, and more. In this demo
      we use Amazon Personalize to select an offer to show to a consumer
      that can be redeemed in-store. The consumer has the extra convenience
      and we have enaged with them in a targeted fashion and, moreover,
      attracted them into our bricks and mortar store where the experience
      will be, naturally, more personal than online.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also an in-store interface that shows a sample view for store
      staff showing orders that are about to be collected, and transactional messaging
      for user and store staff around pickup that is triggered by the user approaching
      the store for pickup.

      <template #title>Using the Location Services Demo</template>
      <template #default>
        <p>

          To use the Amazon Location functionality, Location Services must be enabled in your region.
          First, ensure you are deploying Retail Demo Store in a region in which
          Location is enabled. Next, enable
          <span class="cloudformation-text">"Deploy Location Services resources"</span>
          and <span class="cloudformation-text">"Deploy personalized offers and
          pickup notices using Location Services geofencing"</span>
          when deploying or updating the solution from CloudFormation.
          A Location geofence will be set up for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          From any Retail Demo Store "Shop" menu You can access the Location "In-Store View"
          where you can see orders made to be collected from in-store. From there you can navigate to
          "Location Geofence" where you can see the Location Services-provided map and simulated user
          - from here you can initiate
          simulations of users travelling close to the default configured store either during a scenario
          where Location Services can be used to enable a quick collection of bought products
          and related messaging using Pinpoint Transactional Messaging to email, SMS or web
          ("collection" scenario), or where the user might be inspired to enter the store to make a
          new purhcase through the triggering of personalised messages sent using Pinpoint Campaigns
          to email, SMS and web, either containing offers chosen with Amazon Personalize or containing
          notices about unfinished shopping carts ("purchase" scenario).
        </p>
        <h2 class="feature-subheading">Enable email sending.</h2>
        <p>
          If you are in the email "sandbox" for Pinpoint, then <em>all recipient
          emails must be verified</em> according to the below process, to ensure
          that the emails will be sent.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>After deploying the demo, navigate to your Pinpoint application
            called "retaildemostore" in the UI Console
            (https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home making sure that the region
            is the same one in which you deployed your
            demo).
          </li>
          <li>Click on "Settings" > "Email" in the navigation menu.</li>
          <li>Under the "Identities" tab, click "Edit".</li>
          <li>Ensure the email channel for the project is set to "Enabled"
            (this will be set after Amazon Personalize campaigns
            are finished deploying, but you may set it beforehand).
          </li>
          <li>For the email that you used when you deployed the solution
            under "Reply-To email address", ensure that the email
            address is verified. Select this as your "Default sender address".
          </li>
          <li>For every email to which you plan to send emails,
            ensure that the email address is verified.
          </li>
          <li>Save the changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that you can manage your email and SMS limits within the
          "Settings" > "Email" and "Settings" > "SMS and voice"
          menus available under your Pinpoint project.
          Also note that there are additional limits imposed when your account is
          in the Pinpoint "sandbox".
        </p>
        <h2 class="feature-subheading">Enable SMS sending.</h2>
        <p>
          Ensure any phone number in the Pinpoint database
          to which you intend to send promotional messages (the "purchase" journey
          above - for the "collection" journey, the phone number will be recorded against the order)
          has opted in to receive promotional messages. For more information on how to ensure this,
          see the <em>"Two-Way SMS with Pinpoint"</em> section in the
          <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/workshop/4-Messaging/4.1-Pinpoint.ipynb">
            Pinpoint messaging workshop.</a>
          In brief, you need to (in the USA):
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Subscribe to a long-code that supports SMS through the Pinpoint UI so that Pinpoint has a number
            to send messages from (this is a requirement in the USA to send messages).
          </li>
          <li>Enable 2-way messaging on that long-code and choose the SNS PinpointIncomingTextAlerts
            topic that was deployed along with Retail Demo Store to send messages to, so that responses
            to verification SMS messages can be processed to opt in users.
          </li>
          <li>Enter your phone number from the UI to start the verification process and reply to the text
            message sent to your phone to opt in.
          </li>
        </ol>
