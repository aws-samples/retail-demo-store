    <p>
      Recommends popular products based on how many times customers have viewed an item. The most popular items have the most
      "View" interactions with unique users. The recipe returns the same popular items for all users. Therefore, recommendations are
      not personalized to the individual user and are useful when you want a system-wide representation of what's popular.
    </p>

    <p>
      Popular by Views is implemented used on the homepage to display popular items when there is not browsing
      history for the current user (i.e. cold user). Once the known or anonymous user has more than three interactions (this
      is an arbitrary number chosen in the Retail Demo Store's implementation), the storefront will switch to a personalized
      recommendation using the Recommended For You retail recommender. You can tell when this transition is made when the homepage
      grid header changes from "Popular products" to "Inspired by your shopping trends".
