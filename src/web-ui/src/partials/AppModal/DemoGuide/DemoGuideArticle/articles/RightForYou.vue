        previously purchased. *StockX,* a Detroit startup company revolutionizing ecommerce with a unique Bid/Ask

        which ultimately became the top-performing homepage row. *Mecca, *a beauty retailer in Australia and New
        Zealand, realized a 65% increase in e-mail click-through rates and a corresponding increase in email revenue

            “At MECCA it’s about earning and keeping customer trust. We have challenged ourselves to translate our
            highly personalized in-store service to our online experience. A fast and effective PoC with Amazon
            Personalize, led by the MECCA technology and CRM teams, in collaboration with our partner Servian,
            demonstrated how much we could achieve without developing our own recommendation engine. Since integrating
            Personalize, we are seeing our customers respond positively to the new recommendations with a 65% increase
            in e-mail click-through rates and a corresponding increase in email revenue relating to the products
            recommended by Personalize. To personalize our customer experience further, we are now extending the use of
            Personalize to additional areas including our website.“
