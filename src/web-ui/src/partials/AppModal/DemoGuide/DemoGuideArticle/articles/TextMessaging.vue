    <template #heading>Text Messaging (SMS): Personalized Alerts and Promotions</template>

    <p>
      Amazon Pinpoint has deep configuration options for SMS (text) messaging and can deliver messages to every country
      in the world. Retail / eCommerce organizations have many use cases for text messaging - including transactional
      uses like purchase confirmations and marketing uses like promotions. These messages can be augmented with data
      output from ML services like Amazon Personalize for Personalization, Recommendations, Next-Best-Actions, among
      other use cases. User attributes from Amazon Personalize can be selected within the Amazon Pinpoint console or API
      in order to personalize the content of templates in real-time. Importantly, this enables organizations to deliver
      a unified, omni-channel personalization experience.

    <h2 class="feature-subheading">Enable SMS sending for the USA.</h2>
        <p>
          In the USA it is a legal requirement that you subscribe to a phone number or
          long code in order to be able to send text messages and receive them.
          If you have not followed the Pinpoint messaging workshop to enable
          messaging, but you set "Auto-Configure Pinpoint" to "Yes" when you deployed
          the demo, you are almost set up. The following steps show how you can finish set-up:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Subscribe to a long-code or phone number that supports SMS through the Pinpoint UI so that Pinpoint has a number
            to send messages from.
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint">Pinpoint AWS console</a> in the region into which Retail Demo Store is deployed.</li>
              <li>Choose "Settings ... SMS" or "Settings...  Voice and SMS"</li>
              <li>Click "Request phone number", choosing "United States" for the country.</li>
              <li>Ensure the number type is "Toll-free" and that "SMS" option is checked.</li>
              <li>Click "Next" then "Request".</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Enable two-way SMSs to enable Retail Demo Store to receive messages sent to the dedicated number and opt in users.
            <ol>
              <li>Go back to "Settings ... SMS" or "Settings...  Voice and SMS"</li>
              <li>Click on your newly registered phone number under "Number settings"</li>
              <li>Expand "Two-way SMS" and click "Enable two-way SMS".</li>
              <li>Under "Incoming messages destination" click "Choose an existing SNS topic" and choose the topic that contains the text "PinpointIncomingTextAlertsSNSTopic"
              which was put there by CloudFormation when you deployed your store. </li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Tell Retail Demo Store about the phone number you have acquired.
            <ol>
              <li>So that Retail Demo Store can make use of the dedicated number you acquired above, take note of the number
                and navigate to <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/home">Systems Manager AWS console</a> in the region Retail Demo Store is deployed.</li>
              <li>Find the parameter named "retaildemostore-pinpoint-sms-longcode" and click on "edit", then enter the value for your dedicated the phone number (including the country code as in `+11234567890`).
              You may also enter this information when deploying Retail Demo Store with CloudFormation.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

      <p>
