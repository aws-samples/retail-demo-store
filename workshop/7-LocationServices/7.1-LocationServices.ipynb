    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Retail Demo Store Location Workshop. In this module we're going to be seeing a very simple example of how Amazon Location Services can be used as the basis for location-sensitive marketing and transacting. By using location events to initiate user flows, we can catch shoppers when they are in the right place and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we illustrate the use case of reminders for users to pick up orders. Here we make use of Amazon Pinpoint Transactional Messaging to send these transactional messages. We might equally send reminder campaigns based on recent purchases by users and products available or in overstock in stores nearby. If we were to do that we might use Pinpoint campaigns set up to message users based on events that we propagate from Location Services to Pinpoint using a similar method to that described here.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For a more in-depth example using Amazon Personalize to generate personalized offers, the use of \"Campaigns\" in Amazon Pinpoint to target users with unfinished purchases and incorporate Amazon Personalize output, and the maps functionality of Amazon Location Services to visualise user behaviour, see the Location Services demo on the UI - see \"Retail Geofencing and Location-aware Personalization\" in the demo guide for details of that functionality.*\n",
