    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will define and launch an experiment using a solution to the [multi-armed bandit problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) to evaluate multiple recommendation approaches concurrently. If you have not already stepped through the **[3.1-Overview](./3.1-Overview.ipynb)** workshop notebook, please do so now as it provides the foundation built upon in this exercise. It is also suggested, but not required, to complete the **[3.2-AB-Experiment](./3.2-AB-Experiment.ipynb)** and **[3.3-Interleaving-Experiment](./3.3-Interleaving-Experiment.ipynb)** workshop notebooks.\n",

    "Since this module uses the Retail Demo Store's Recommendation microservice to run experiments across variations that depend on the search and personalization features of the Retail Demo Store, it is assumed that you have either completed the [Search](../0-StartHere/Search.ipynb) and [Personalization](../1-Personalization/1.1-Personalize.ipynb) workshops or those resources have been pre-provisioned in your AWS environment. If you are unsure and attending an AWS managed event such as a workshop, check with your event lead."

    "## Exercise 3: Multi-Armed Bandit Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first two exercises we demonstrated how to create and run experiments using a traditional A/B test and an interleaving recommendations test. Both of those approaches require the sequential steps of creating the experiment, running the experiment, and then evaluating the results to determine if a statistically valid preference emerged. The time when the experiment is running is typically referred to as the **exploration** phase since we are exposing users to two variations and gathering the data necessary to draw a conclusion. Only after the test has completed can we use the winning variation across all users to maximize conversion. This is referred to the **exploitation** phase. Minimizing exploration without jeopardizing the integrity of the results in order to maximize exploitation are fundamental elements to any successful experimentation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will take a entirely different approach to evaluating multiple recommendation implementations concurrently where the best performing variation is measured and exploited in real-time based on user feedback but the other variations are still ocassionally explored should the probabilities for conversion change over time. This approach is often referred to as the multi-armed bandit problem since it is analagous to the gambler entering a room of slot machines (i.e. one-armed bandits) and having to decide which arm to pull, how many times to pull each arm, and when to try other machines to maximize the payout.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-armed bandit approach is ideal for experimentation use-cases in short-lived and dynamic environments with many variations where longer drawn out testing approaches are unfeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although bandit testing can support tens of variations in a single experiment, we will use three variations for this exercise. The first variation will represent our current implementation using the **Default Product Resolver**, the second variation will use the **Similar Products Resolver**, and the third variation will use the **Personalize Recommendation Resolver**. We will simulate this experiment using the related products feature on the product detail page. The following screenshot illustrates what an active multi-armed bandit test would look like on the product detail page with experiment annotations.\n",

    "### MultiArmedBanditExperiment Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Before stepping through creating and executing our multi-armed bandit test, let's look at the relevant source code for the **MultiArmedBanditExperiment** class that implements this experiment type in the Retail Demo Store project.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in the **3.1-Overview** notebook, all experiment types are subclasses of the abstract **Experiment** class. See **[3.1-Overview](./3.1-Overview.ipynb)** for more details on the experimentation framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MultiArmedBanditExperiment.get_items()` method is where item recommendations are retrieved for the experiment. This method will select the variation using [Thompson Sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling) as a [Beta Bernoulli sampler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution). Thompson Sampling is just one of many possible multi-armed bandit algorthims. Two other common algorithms are Eplsilon Greedy and Upper Confidence Bound 1 (UCB-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thompson Sampling can yield more balanced results in marginal cases. A probability (beta) distribution is maintained for each variation based on the conversion rate observed from user behavior. For each exposure, we sample one possible conversion rate from each variation's beta distribution and select the variation the highest conversion rate. The more data that is gathered, the more confident the algorithm becomes.\n",

    "You have completed all three exercises for the Retail Demo Store Experimentation workshop. Although we focused on experimenation around different approaches to personalization, these experimentation techniques can be applied to many other user experiences in your website. \n",
    "\n",
    "We started with a traditional A/B test where a default product recommendation approach was tested against personalized product recommendations from Amazon Personalize. Then we used an interleaved experiment to test two product recommendation approaches concurrently to shorten the testing duration. Finally, we deployed a multi-armed bandit approach to test 3 personalization approaches to maximize exploitation of the best performing variation while still exploring across all other variations. It's important to note that these techniques are not mutually exlusive. In other words, it's common to use interleaving or multi-armed bandit experiments as a preliminary step to identify the best performing variations from a larger pool followed by A/B experiments of the top performers."
