    "# Retail Demo Store Experimentation Workshop - Amazon CloudWatch Evidently\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we will create an A/B experiment using [Amazon CloudWatch Evidently](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/features/). Evidently lets application developers conduct experiments and identify unintended consequences of new features before rolling them out for general use, thereby reducing risk related to new feature roll-out. Evidently allows you to validate new features across the full application stack before release, which makes for a safer release. When launching new features, you can expose them to a small user base, monitor key metrics such as page load times or conversions, and then dial up traffic. Evidently also allows you to try different designs, collect user data, and release the most effective design in production. \n",

    "To get started with CloudWatch Evidently, for either a feature launch or an A/B experiment, you first create a project. A project is a logical grouping of resources. Within the project, you create features that have variations that you want to test or launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Retail Demo Store project was deployed in your account, an Evidently project and several Evidently features were automatically created. These resources are defined in the [evidently.yaml](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/aws/cloudformation-templates/base/evidently.yaml) CloudFormation stack. Open a new browser window/tab and browse to [CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home); under \"Application monitoring\" in the left navigation, you will find Evidently.\n",

    "When a user is interacting with web application views like the home page, product detail page, the search auto-complete drop-down, and the shop livestreams page, the web application will make requests to the Recommendations microservice to retrieve or order products for the given user experience. One of the parameters passed with each of these requests is the feature name. The feature name is mapped to Evidently features. The following application features are already instrumented in the Retail Demo Store web application as well as mapped to Evidently features in the Evidently project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Home page (top)**: the top of the home page view displays recommended products in two states: when the current visitor/user is new/cold and when the current visitor is warm. The new/cold visitor/user is automatically transitioned to the warm experience after 2 product view events have been sent to the Personalize event tracker. Selecting an existing shopper also puts the user into the warm user experience.\n",
    "    - \"**Popular products**\": for new/cold users, displays popular products in a grid widget. The feature name is `home_product_recs_cold`.\n",
    "    - \"**Inspired by your shopping trends**\": for existing/warm users, displays products from one of the supported product recommenders configured in the Recommendations microservice. The feature name is `home_product_recs`.\n",
    "- **Home page (bottom)**: the bottom of the home page view displays featured products in a carousel widget.\n",
    "    - \"**Featured products**\": this is the carousel widget at the bottom of the home page view where featured products are displayed. The feature name is `home_featured_rerank`.\n",
    "- **Product detail page**: when you click on a product, you are taken to the product detail view.\n",
    "    - \"**Compare similar items**\": this the carousel widget on the product detail view that displays products similar to the product being displayed. The feature name is `product_detail_related`.\n",
    "- **Navigation**: the header navigation.\n",
    "    - \"**Search results**\": this is the search drop-down in the web application's navigational header. For this feature, we can test personalized ranking of search results against search results that are ordered by Amazon OpenSearch. The feature name is `search_results`.\n",
    "- **Shop live streams**: on the \"Shop\" drop-down is a \"Shop Livestreams\" option. This page provides a live streaming interface for demonstrating products and making recommendations.\n",
    "    - \"**Shop livestreams - discounted products**\": this is the sidebar vertical widget on the Shop Livestreams page. It displays discounted products highighted in the live stream.  The feature name is `live_stream_prod_recommendation`.\n",

    "Let's examine the Evidently integration in more detail. \n",

    "- You start by creating features in Evidently mapped to user experiences in your application that you want to control with launch/feature flags or experiments. As mentioned above, this was already done for you in the Retail Demo Store during deployment. User experiences can be as simple as a view title or button color or as complex as a panel or widget.\n",
    "- Next you instrument the user interface logic in your application for each feature to call Evidently to determine the variation to use. Each feature can have one or more variations and each variation has a value that can be a boolean/flag, number, or string. In our case, we're storing small JSON snippets as string variation values. The JSON contains the details needed to map a variation value to a recommender implementation.\n",
    "- Experiments can be created for features by specifying the experiment duration, how to split traffic across variations, metrics that will be collected to measure the outcome of the experiment, and more.\n",
    "- Your application calls the Evidently [EvaluateFeature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_EvaluateFeature.html) or [BatchEvaluateFeature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_BatchEvaluateFeature.html) API to retrieve the variation details for given feature(s) for the current user. This can be done in the client using the AWS SDK for JavaScript or server-side using any of the supported language SDKs. For the Retail Demo Store, these calls are made in the Recommendations microservice. \n",
    "   - If an experiment is active for a feature, the evaluate feature response will include a `reason` of `EXPERIMENT_RULE_MATCH`. In this case, you also need to send an experiment exposure event to Evidently to indicate that the current user is receiving the assigned variation.\n",
    "- When/if the user \"converts\" against a variation that is part of an experiment, a \"conversion\" event needs to be sent to Evidently. In our case, a conversion is when the user clicks on a product included in a variation's recommended products. The Retail Demo Store web application calls the `/experiment/outcome` endpoint on the Recommendations microservice which then calls the Evidently [PutProjectEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_PutProjectEvents.html) API.\n",
