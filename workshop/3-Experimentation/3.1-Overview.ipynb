    "# Retail Demo Store Experimentation Workshop - Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Retail Demo Store Experimentation Workshop. In this module we are going to add experimentation to our Retail Demo Store eCommerce website. This will allow us to experiment with different personalization approaches in the user interface. We take two different approaches adding experimention. First, we'll explore how to implement three different experimentation techniques from the ground up. This is the DIY path. Then we will explore how to use solutions from AWS partners [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) and [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in experimentation techniques include the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A/B testing\n",
    "- Interleaving recommendation testing\n",
    "- Multi-armed bandit testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Each experimentation technique will be described in detail as well as how to evaluate results. Although these techniques will be used to measure different approaches to personalization, the framework presented can be easily used for other experimentation use-cases as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS partner workshops Amplitude and Optimizely each use the A/B testing technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshops can be performed in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Time: 15 minutes this notebook, ~1.5 hours total for all experiment workshops\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this module uses the Retail Demo Store's Recommendation microservice to run experiments across variations that depend on the personalization features of the Retail Demo Store, it is assumed that you have either completed the [Personalization](../1-Personalization/Lab-01-(Core)-Introduction-and-data-preparation.ipynb) workshop or those resources have been pre-provisioned and configured in your AWS environment. If you are unsure and attending an AWS managed event such as a workshop or immersion day, check with your event lead."

    "## Experimentation Framework and Built-In Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can dive into the first experimentation technique, let's review the overall architecture (depicted below) and some of the code. Although this experimentation framework is implemented in the Python programming language, it can be easily ported to many other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "> All of the source code for the experimentation architecture described here can be found in the Retail Demo Store's [Recommendations](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/recommendations) web service which is in a Git repository (AWS CodeCommit or GitHub) attached to AWS CodePipeline in your AWS environment.\n",

    "![Experimentation Class Diagram](./images/experimentation-class-diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with **Variation**. In the context of this workshop, a **Varation** is a specific approach to providing product recommendations or ranking product lists for a user. As mentioned above, this framework can be used to test variations of any feature in the Retail Demo Store--we're just focusing on testing different approaches to making product recommendations or ranking products. A **Variation** represents the configuration information necessary to create a **Resolver** (described below) that is used to retrieve recommendations or rank a list of products. For example, for a variation backed by an Amazon Personalize campaign, the variation configuration would specify the Campaign ARN. For a variation backed by a \"similar item\" OpenSearch query in the Search service, the variation configuration would specify the host/IP for the Retail Demo Store Search microservice. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code for the [**Variation**](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/src/recommendations/src/recommendations-service/experimentation/experiment.py) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# from src/recommendations/src/recommendations-service/experimentation/experiment.py\n",
    "\n",
    "class Variation:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, **data):\n",
    "        self.config = data\n",
    "        self.resolver = ResolverFactory.get(**data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There's not much to this class. It's holding the configuration information in `self.config` and creating the **Resolver** based on the configuration. The **ResolverFactory.get()** function takes the configuration for a resolver (it's type and initialization parameters) and returns the appropriate **Resolver** instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resolver\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, a [**Resolver**](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/src/recommendations/src/recommendations-service/experimentation/resolvers.py) retrieves product recommendations or ranks a product list for a particular **Variation**. Here is the code for the **Resolver** abstract base class.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# from src/recommendations/src/recommendations-service/experimentation/resolvers.py\n",
    "\n",

    "            List of dictionaries where each dictionary minimally includes an 'itemId' key representing a recommended item\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, a resolver only needs to implement the `get_items()` method. This method should return a list of dictionaries where each dictionary must have an `itemId` key with a value representing the ID for a recommended item. For this project, an item is a product. Here is a sample response with three items.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[ \n",
    "    {\n",
    "        'itemId': '56'\n",
    "    }, \n",

    "    }, \n",
    "    {\n",
    "        'itemId': '13'\n",
    "    }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six implementations of **Resolver** provided in this project. Four resolvers are used for the product recommendation and related item use-cases and two resolvers are used for the product list ranking use-case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DefaultProductResolver\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**DefaultProductResolver**](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/src/recommendations/src/recommendations-service/experimentation/resolvers.py) will call the Retail Demo Store's Product microservice to retrieve a list of products in the same category of the current product. If the current product does not have an assigned category, the resolver will fallback to recommending featured products. Given the same product, all users will receive the same product recommendations. Therefore, this resolver does not provide personalized recommendations and is a good example of a very basic approach to making product suggestions.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [**SearchSimilarProductsResolver**](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/src/recommendations/src/recommendations-service/experimentation/resolvers.py) leverages the Retail Demo Store's Search service to retrieve a ranked list of products similar to the current product. Internally the Search service uses the OpenSearch \"[more like this](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-mlt-query.html)\" query type. This can be considered a content filtering approach but still not personalized. Nevertheless, it is an improvement over **DefaultProductResolver** since items are ranked by relevance based on similarities across multiple product fields.\n",

    "### Experiment Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulling together the concepts of variations and resolvers described above, there are three experimentation strategies implemented in this project. Each of the experimentation techniques are implemented as a subclass of the [**Experiment**](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/src/recommendations/src/recommendations-service/experimentation/experiment.py) abstract base class.\n",

    "#### Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**Experiment**](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/src/recommendations/src/recommendations-service/experimentation/experiment.py) class defines the contract required for all subclasses as well as provides some utility methods for creating correlation identifiers and tracking exposure and outcome events. An exposure represents a user being exposed to an experiment variation and an outcome represents a user interacting with an exposure item (i.e. clicking on a recommended product).\n",

    "\n",
    "The [**Interleaving Experiment**](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/src/recommendations/src/recommendations-service/experimentation/experiment_interleaving.py) class provides an implementation of interleaving or blending recommendations from two or more variations for each user. There are two interleaving method implementations provided. The **Balanced Method** balances selections from each variation in an alternating fashion. The **Team Draft Method** uses the analogy of team captains that are randomly selected for each round to select their next top \"player\" when building the interleaved results.\n",

While working through the exercises in this workshop you can open the Retail Demo Store's Web UI in another browser tab/window and verify that your experiment is active and working as expected.
