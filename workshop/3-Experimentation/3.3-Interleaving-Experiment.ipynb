    "Since this module uses the Retail Demo Store's Recommendation microservice to run experiments across variations that depend on the personalization features of the Retail Demo Store, it is assumed that you have either completed the [Personalization](../1-Personalization/1.1-Personalize.ipynb) workshop or those resources have been pre-provisioned in your AWS environment. If you are unsure and attending an AWS managed event such as a workshop, check with your event lead."

    "## Exercise 2: Interleaving Recommendations Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first exercise, **[3.2-AB-Experiment](./3.2-AB-Experiment.ipynb)**, we demonstrated how to create and run an A/B experiment using two different variations for making product recommendations. We calculated the sample sizes of users needed to reach a statistically significant result comparing the two variations. Then we ran the experiment using a simulation until the sample sizes were reached for both variations. In real-life, depending on the baseline and minimum detectable effect rate combined with your site's user traffic, the amount of time necessary to complete an experiment can take several days to a few weeks. This can be expensive from both an opportunity cost perspective as well as negatively impacting the pace at which experiments and changes can be rolled out to your site.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will look at an alternative approach to evaluating product recommendation variations that requires a smaller sample size and shorter experiment durations. This technique is often used as a preliminary step before formal A/B testing to reduce a larger number of variations to just the top performers. Traditional A/B testing is then done against the best performing variations, significantly reducing the overall time necessary for experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the same two variations as the last exercise. The first variation will represent our current implementation using the **Default Product Resolver** and the second variation will use the **Personalize Recommendation Resolver**. The scenario we are simulating is adding product recommendations powered by Amazon Personalize to the home page and measuring the impact/uplift in click-throughs for products as a result of deploying a personalization strategy. We will use the same hypothesis from our A/B test where the conversion rate of our existing approach is 15% and we expect a 25% lift in this rate by adding personalized recommendations."

    "### What is Interleaving Recommendation Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach of interleaving recommendations is to take the recommendations from two or more variations and interleave, or blend, them into a single set of recommendations for *every user in the experiment*. Because each user in the sample is exposed to recommendations from all variations, we gain some key benefits. First, the sample size can be smaller since we don't need separate groups of users for each variation. This also results in a shorter experiment duration. Additionally, this approach is less susceptible to variances in user type and behavior that could throw off the results of an experiment. For example, it's not uncommon to have power users who shop/watch/listen/read much more than a typical user. With multiple sample groups, the behavior of these users can throw off results for their group, particularly with smaller sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Care must be taken in how recommendations are interleaved, though, to account for position bias in the recommendations and to track variation attribution. There are two common methods to interleaving recommendations. First is a balanced approach where recommendations are taken from each variation in an alternating style where the starting variation is selected randomly. The other approach follows the team-draft analogy where team captains select their \"best player\" (recommendation) from the variations in random selection order. Both methods can result in different interleaving outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interleaving recommendations as an approach to experimenation got its start with information retrieval systems and search engines (Yahoo! & Bing) where different approaches to ranking results could be measured concurrently. More recently, [Netflix has adopted the interleaving technique](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/interleaving-in-online-experiments-at-netflix-a04ee392ec55) to rapidly evaluate different approaches to making movie recommendations to its users. The image below depicts the recommendations from two different recommenders/variations (Ranker A and Ranker B) and examples of how they are interleaved.\n",

    "Before stepping through creating and executing our interleaving test, let's look at the relevant source code for the **InterleavingExperiment** class that implements this experiment type in the Retail Demo Store project.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in the **[3.1-Overview](./3.1-Overview.ipynb)** notebook, all experiment types are subclasses of the abstract **Experiment** class. See **[3.1-Overview](./3.1-Overview.ipynb)** for more details on the experimentation framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `InterleavingExperiment.get_items()` method is where item recommendations are retrieved for the experiment. This method will retrieve recommendations from the resolvers for all variations and then use the configured interleaving method (balanced or team-draft) to interleave the recommendations to produce the final result. Exposure tracking is also implemented to facilitate measuring the outcome of an experiment. The implementations for the balanced and team-draft interleaving methods are not included below but are available in the source code for the Recommendations service.\n",
