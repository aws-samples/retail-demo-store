Although implementing a testing framework from scratch will work, significant technical work is required to get up and running. It's very likely that costly errors can be made when trying to solve the fundamentals of an A/B testing framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Making variation assignment random\n",
    "- Ensuring traffic is equally split between the variations\n",
    "- Implementing success metrics\n",
    "- Reporting on test outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the logic to run and measure your experiment is built, you may run into additional problems and features to improve. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What if you want to limit the percentage of users that get into your experiment?\n",
    "- How do you make changes to a running test?\n",
    "- How do you pause a test once it’s complete?\n",
    "- How do you make sure your test findings are accurate?\n",
    "- How will you ensure that the home-built solution scales and is reliable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements for robust experimentation can quickly snowball into a lot of work. Rather than tackling these problems as they arise, another option is to use or build on top of an existing external platform. This workshop covers using Optimizely’s Full Stack Experimentation product to more easily and quickly execute an A/B test.\n"

    "## What is Optimizely Full Stack?\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizely Full Stack is a progressive delivery and experimentation platform for product and engineering teams, which allows you to both progressively release new features to your users as well as experiment with different versions of the features. Full Stack is implemented directly within client-side or server-side code via a Software Development Kit (SDK) available in [many languages](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/quickstarts), or as its own standalone service using [Optimizely Agent](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/use-optimizely-agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation of Optimizely Full Stack provides users with a suite of functions that enable delivery of new application features, as well as experimentation on existing features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Flags**: The ability to remotely toggle features on/off\n",
    "- **Feature Rollouts**: Increase or decrease the percentage of users exposed to a feature flag at any point in time\n",
    "- **Feature Variables**: Add a variable to any feature, allowing for aspects of a feature to be remotely configured at any time\n",
    "- **Feature Experimentation**: Create variations of any existing feature and measure the impact of feature changes on conversion metrics\n",
    "- **Audience Attributes**: Create user attributes for results segmentation and audience targeting use-cases\n",
    "- **Event Tracking**: Track interactions to measure user impact\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize these features watch this [4 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVjnOYi4214).\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get started with Optimizely is to use one of our SDKs for the language in which your application is written.  In this workshop, you will integrate Optimizely Full Stack, using the [Python SDK](https://optimizely-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/).  The Python SDK will be used in the Recommendations service of the Retail Demo Store to run experiments across the three personalization use cases of the Retail Demo Store.  In your own environments, you can also deploy Optimizely as a service using [Optimizely Agent](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/use-optimizely-agent), which is ideal for microservice environments or environments where Optimizely does not have an SDK for a particular language.

    "## How Optimizely Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below illustrates how the Optimizely service works.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Optimizely Architecture](./images/optimizely/architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Optimizely Application (on the left-hand-side) allows you to create/launch feature configurations and tests from the Optimizely Application, as well as create metrics to measure experiment outcomes.\n",
    "2. All the relevant experiment information you've saved in Optimizely is populated to a condensed JSON format called the datafile. The datafile contains information such as:\n",
    "   1. Experiments that are running\n",
    "   2. Variations of the variables in those running experiments\n",
    "   3. Traffic allocation percentages of the experiment variations\n",
    "3. Optimizely’s SDKs use the project datafile to create an Optimizely instance, either client-side or server-side, that buckets users into the A/B test.\n",
    "4. Interaction events are tracked asynchronously back to Optimizely’s results pages, allowing users to measure the impact of their experiments \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizely is integrated into the Retail Demo Store, and with Amazon Personalize as shown in the architecture diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Optimizely in Retail Demo Store Architecture](./images/optimizely/retail-demo-store-architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Optimizely Buckets Users\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizely Full Stack uses a hashing algorithm that combines the user ID, feature flag key, and traffic allocation percentage to determine user bucketing. This allows bucketing to occur in the SDK code, rather than requiring the SDK to communicate with an external API. This method ensures that bucketing decisions happen in matter of microseconds, minimizing the performance impact on your application. It also ensures that users receive the same variation in an experiment, even if traffic allocation is increased. More information available [here](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/how-bucketing-works#:~:text=Bucketing%20is%20the%20process%20of,which%20variation%20they%20should%20see.)."
