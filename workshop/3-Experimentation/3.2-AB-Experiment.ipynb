    "Since this module uses the Retail Demo Store's Recommendation service to run experiments across variations that depend on the personalization features of the Retail Demo Store, it is assumed that you have either completed the [Personalization](../1-Personalization/1.1-Personalize.ipynb) workshop or those resources have been pre-provisioned in your AWS environment. If you are unsure and attending an AWS managed event such as a workshop, check with your event lead."

    "## Exercise 1: A/B Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first exercise we will demonstrate how to use the A/B testing technique to implement an experiment over two implementations, or variations, of product recommendations. The first variation will represent our current implementation using the **Default Product Resolver** and the second variation will use the **Personalize Resolver**. The scenario we are simulating is adding product recommendations powered by Amazon Personalize to home page and measuring the impact/uplift in click-throughs for products as a result of deploying a personalization strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is A/B Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing, also known as bucket or split testing, is used to compare the performance of two variations (A and B) of a single variable/experience  by exposing separate groups of users to each variation and measuring user responses. An A/B experiment is run for a period of time, typically dictated by the number of users necessary to reach a statistically significant result, followed by statistical analysis of the results to determine if a conclustion can be reached as to the best performing variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Experiment Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Website analytics have shown that user sessions frequently end on the home page for our e-commerce site, the Retail Demo Store. Furthermore, when users do make a purchase, most purchases are for a single product. Currently on our home page we are using a basic approach of recommending featured products. We hypothesize that adding personalized recommendations to the home page will result in increasing the click-through rate of products by 25%. The current click-through rate is 15%."

    "Before stepping through creating and executing our A/B test, let's look at the relevant source code for the **ABExperiment** class that implements A/B experiments in the Retail Demo Store project.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `ABExperiment.get_items()` method is where item recommendations are retrieved for the experiment. The `ABExperiment.calculate_variation_index()` method is where users are assigned to a variation/group using a consistent hashing algorithm. This ensures that each user is assigned to the same variation across multiple requests for recommended items for the duration of the experiment. Once the variation is determined, the variation's **Resolver** is used to retrieve recommendations. Details on the experiment are added to item list to support conversion/outcome tracking and UI annotation. \n",
