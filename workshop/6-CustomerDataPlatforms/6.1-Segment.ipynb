    "# Omnichannel Personalization with Segment\n",
    "\n",
    "This module uses Amazon Personalize to generate and associate personalized product recommendations for users then execute an omnichannel personalization campaign using Segment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Estimated time: 30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of this workshop is presented with the assumption that you have either completed the Personalization workshop or those resources have been pre-provisioned in your AWS environment. If you are unsure and attending an AWS managed event such as a workshop, check with your event lead.\n",

    "## Segment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Segment is a customer data platform (CDP) that helps you collect, clean, and control your customer data. Segment provides several types of Sources which you can use to collect your data, and which you can choose from based on the needs of your app or site. For websites, you can use a javascript library to collect data. If you have a mobile app, you can embed one of Segment’s Mobile SDKs, and if you’d like to create messages directly on a server (if you have, for example a dedicated .NET server that processes payments), Segment has several server-based libraries that you can embed directly into your backend code. With Segment, you can also use cloud-sources to import data about your app or site from other tools like Zendesk or Salesforce, to enrich the data sent through Segment. By using Segment to decouple data collection from data use, you can create a centralized data supply chain based on organized and modular data.\n",
