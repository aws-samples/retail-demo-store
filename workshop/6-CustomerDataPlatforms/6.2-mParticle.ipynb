    "# Real Time Omnichannel Personalization with mParticle\n",
    "\n",
    "This module uses Amazon Personalize to generate and associate personalized product recommendations for users then execute an omnichannel personalization campaign using mParticle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Estimated time: 30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complete this workshop, you will need to complete the 1.1-Personalize workbook in this directory.  You will also need a mParticle workspace.  If you are doing this workshop as part of a live workshop event, ask your moderator how to set up a mParticle workspace.  If you are running this workshop on your own, you can email or reach out to  [dl-mparticle-workshops@mparticle.com](mailto://dl-mparticle-workshops@mparticle.com) to request for the creation of a mParticle account.  We do not recommend using your production mParticle workspace for this workshop.\n",

    "## mParticle Platform Overview\n",
    "mParticle is a customer data platform (CDP) that helps you collect, clean, and control your customer data. mParticle provides several types of Sources which you can use to collect your data, and which you can choose from based on the needs of your app or site. For websites, you can use a javascript library to collect data. If you have a mobile app, you can embed one of mParticle’s Mobile SDKs, and if you’d like to create messages directly on a server (if you have, for example a dedicated .NET server that processes payments), mParticle has several server-based libraries that you can embed directly into your backend code. With mParticle, you can also use cloud-sources to import data about your app or site from other tools like Zendesk or Salesforce, to enrich the data sent through mParticle. By using mParticle to decouple data collection from data use, you can create a centralized data supply chain based on organized and modular data.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we are going to integrate Braze with mParticle using the Braze Partner-Kit (https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-javascript-integration-appboy) such that we can showcase how a CDP can simplify and lessen the development effort across the different downstream systems that you are planning to integrate with mParticle.\n",
    "\n",
    "mParticle provides a variety of partner-kits (https://github.com/mparticle-integrations). These partner-kits allows mParticle to abstract the data collection from your source application and automatically instrument or forward it to the integrated systems with mParticle without the need of writing the 3rd party's vendor SDK. Through this approach, you as a developer will only require to include the partner-kits within your project and only write a single line of code using the mParticle Web/iOS/Android/etc.. SDK.\n",
