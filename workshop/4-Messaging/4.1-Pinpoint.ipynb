    "# Retail Demo Store Messaging Workshop - Amazon Pinpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we will use [Amazon Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/) to add the ability to dynamically send personalized messages to the customers of the Retail Demo Store. We'll build out the following use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Send new users a welcome email after they sign up for a Retail Demo Store account\n",
    "- When users add items to their shopping cart but do not complete an order, send an email with a coupon code encouraging them to finish their order\n",
    "- Send users an email with product recommendations from the Amazon Personalize campaign we created in the Personalization workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Time: 1 hour\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this module uses Amazon Personalize to generate and associate personalized product recommendations for users, it is assumed that you have either completed the [Personalization](../1-Personalization/1.1-Personalize.ipynb) workshop or those resources have been pre-provisioned in your AWS environment. If you are unsure and attending an AWS managed event such as a workshop, check with your event lead."

AWS Amplify provides libraries for JavaScript, iOS, Andriod, and React Native for building web and mobile applications. For this workshop, we'll be focusing on how user information and events from the Retail Demo Store's Web UI are sent to Pinpoint. This is depicted as **(1)** and **(2)** in the architecture above.

The new user sign up event triggers a call to the `AnalyticsHandler.identify` function where user information from Cognito is used to [update an endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-endpoints.html) in Pinpoint.

    "### Integrating Amazon Pinpoint & Amazon Personalize - Pinpoint Recommenders\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a Campaign in Amazon Pinpoint, you can associate the Pinpoint Campaign with a machine learning model, or recommender, that will be used to retrieve item recommendations for each endpoint eligible for the campaign. A recommender is linked to an Amazon Personalize Campaign. As you may recall from the [Personalization workshop](../1-Personalization/1.1-Personalize.ipynb), a Personalize Campaign only returns a list of item IDs (which represent product IDs for Retail Demo Store products). In order to turn the list of item IDs into more useful information for building a personalized email, Pinpoint supports the option to associate an AWS Lambda function to a recommender. This function is called passing information about the endpoint and the item IDs from Personalize and the function can return metadata about each item ID. Then in your Pinpoint message template you can reference the item metadata to incorporate it into your messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Retail Demo Store architecture already has a [Lambda function](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/blob/master/src/aws-lambda/pinpoint-recommender/pinpoint-recommender.py) deployed to use for our Pinpoint recommender. This function calls to Retail Demo Store's [Products](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/products) microservice to retrieve useful information for each product (name, description, price, image URL, product URL, and so on). We will create a Pinpoint recommender in this workshop to tie it all together. This is depicted as **(3)**, **(4)**, and **(5)** in the architecture above."
