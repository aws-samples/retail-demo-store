    "# Retail Demo Store Messaging Workshop - Braze\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we will use [Braze](https://braze.com/) to add the ability to personalize marketing messages to customers of the Retail Demo Store using customer behavioral data and the Personalize models you trained in the prior workshops. We are going to define a campaign in Braze to send target users an email with product recommendations from the Amazon Personalize campaign we created in the Personalization workshop earlier.  You will also create an email template using the Braze Connected Content feature.  When the campaign is launched, Connected Content will send emails to the users that belong in the target group.  These emails will be formatted using the Personalize Campaign you created earlier.\n",

The content of this workshop is presented with the assumption that you have either completed the [Personalization](../1-Personalization/1.1-Personalize.ipynb) workshop or those resources have been pre-provisioned in your AWS environment. If you are unsure and attending an AWS managed event such as a workshop, check with your event lead.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will need to create a Braze API key for the duration of the workshop.  This API key will be used to create a set of temporary users for the workshop.  These temporary users will be deleted at the end of the workshop."

In this workshop, the demo store uses Amplify to send events to Personalize as shown in the diagram.
