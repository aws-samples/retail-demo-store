    "Layer0 extends the capabilities of a traditional CDN by not only hosting your static content, but also providing server-side rendering for progressive web applications. Layer0 allows caching both your APIs and HTML at the network edge to provide your users with the fastest browsing experience. Teams can ship faster leveraging an enhanced developer experience to deploy code faster and with more frequency, view their code quickly in atomically deployed environments, and integrating their CDN configuration to the overall build process. Layer0 provides the tools needed to build the modern apps capable of providing the performance expected by modern consumers. \n",

    "Among the benefits offered by Layer0, a few offered are: \n",

    "- Prefetching and Deep-fetching\n",
    "- Prerendering\n",
    "- Service working caching\n",
    "- Split testing"

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have Retail Demo Store (RDS) deployed in your AWS account before proceeding. These instructions will allow you to run a Layer0 enabled version of the `web-ui` on local or Layer0 as infrastructure for the RDS front-end, connecting to the APIs deployed in your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer0 application works with the Vue application production build files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create it, follow the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Clone the AWS Retail Demo Store repository to either your local computer or Cloud9\n",
    "1. Make sure your terminal is open in `%project_root%/src/web-ui folder`. You can use your local computer or Cloud9.\n",
    "2. Set NodeJS version to 14. To check your version use `node -v`. If using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node installation versions, set to 14.x using `nvm use <version>`. `nvm ls` will show you your locally available node versions and if needed install a 14.x version to use.\n",
    "3. Install packages: run `npm install` (or just `npm i`)\n",
    "4. Run `./gen_env.sh` to generate the `.env` file.\n",
    "5. Set `VUE_APP_LAYER0_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` in `.env` file.\n",
    "6. Update your `.env` file for either local or layer0 prod deployment variables.\n",
    "7. Use `source .env` to make sure `.env` variables are available in the terminal environment you are working in.\n",
    "8. Build Vue application: `npm run build` (build files will appear in `dist` folder).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development\n",
    "\n",
    "For local development, API endpoints set via your `.env` file should be pointed to the `localhost` Docker container instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "Local development is optional, you can skip this step and go directly to build the project with production values in your `.env` file.\n",
