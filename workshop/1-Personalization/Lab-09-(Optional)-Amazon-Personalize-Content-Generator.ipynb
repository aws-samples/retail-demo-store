    "# Amazon Personalize Content Generator Workshop - Lab 9\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will create thematic descriptions for related items using the Personalize Content Generator. This capability of Personalize uses generative AI under-the-hood to produce a short and compelling description that captures the most impactful thematic elements for a set of items. The thematic descriptions can then be used as the title or label for a carousel or grid widget used to display related items or as part of the email subject when targeting users who may be interested in the items. These generated descriptions are more compelling alternatives than plain titles. For example, \"Ultimate audio quality for all your listening needs\" for a set of audio products rather than \"Compare similar items\" or \"You may also like\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Content Genetator](images/retaildemostore-content-generator-ex3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Content Generator uses a model trained with the [Similar-Items](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/native-recipe-similar-items.html) recipe to identify related items based on a seed item and then uses a large language model (LLM) to generate the thematic description. Although Similar-Items can be used with real-time inference or batch inference, themes can only be generated with batch inference jobs. In addition, using the Content Generator incurs additional cost (see [pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/) for details). For this lab, we will generate themes the similar items for the featured products in the Retail Demo Store catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about the Content Generator in the Personalize [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/personalize-with-gen-ai.html#gen-ai-themed-rec) or [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/11/amazon-personalize-themes-generative-ai/)."
