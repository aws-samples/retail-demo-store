    "# Retail Demo Store - Personalized Offers Workshop - Lab 8\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module we're going to be adding another sample use case of [Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/): selecting offers or coupons to be providing to users. You might imagine these offers to be of the following kind:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Log in to our online store to get 10% off any product!\n",
    " - Enter PERFECTHAIR to get 3 for 2 on hair products online only! This coupon expires tomorrow!\n",
    " - and so forth.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this notebook we'll ask Amazon Personalize to select a coupon for us that is likely to result in a conversion for the given user. We are going to ask Amazon Personalize to choose between the following coupons:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Enter AWS25 to earn a 25% discount on any product in store today!\n",
    " - Enter AMAZON20 to earn a 20% discount on any product in store today!\n",
    " - Enter PERSONALIZE15 to earn a 15% discount on any product in store today!\n",
    " - Enter SAGEMAKER10 to earn a 10% discount on any product in store today!\n",
    " - Enter SALE5 to earn a 5% discount on any product in store today!\n",
    " - No offer given.\n",
    " \n",
    "One issue that this particular scenario brings to the fore is that personalization as generally practiced currently is designed to maximise conversions but choosing different offers for a user results in different costs to us.\n",
    "A relatively new feature of Amazon Personalize is [the use of **additional objective functions**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/optimizing-solution-for-objective.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this feature, we can train Amazon Personalize to produce recommendations to maximise any objective we want - such as return on investment, lifetime value, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can incorporate some decision science into our systems ourselves. In the current context this might mean:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Limiting the number of certain types of offers to assign to users (for example, we might allow Personalize to select users for offers rather than selecting offers for users). In the current scenario, however, we want to ensure that every user has one offer.\n",
    " - Using the \"contextual metadata\" facility of Amazon Personalize to estimate the likely change in behaviour of users under different offer contexts. See the [personalize discounts](./Lab-04-(Core)-Evaluate-recommendations.ipynb) section in an earlier notebook for an idea about how such an approach may work. \n",
    " - Using the scores provided by Personalize as probabilities as part of a decision system where the decision system chooses offers based on expected marginal return or other decision variables such as available coupons and take-up rate. For more about recommendation scores see this [blog article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-recommendation-scores-in-amazon-personalize/). We explore this option more in the present notebook in an empirical way, so that you can see for yourself what kind of scores Amazon Personalize gives back, and how they may be of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation \n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to simulate a simple dataset on which to train Amazon Personalize so that you can see how such a campaign may be trained with Amazon Personalize. Optionally, you can add skew to the data as might happen when certain items are much more valuable than others, so that we can explore how to deal with it via the balancing approaches discussed above.\n",

    "Amazon Personalize provides predefined recipes, based on common use cases, for training models. A recipe is a machine learning algorithm that you use with settings, or hyperparameters, and the data you provide to train an Amazon Personalize model. The data you provide to train a model are organized into separate datasets by the type of data being provided. A collection of datasets are organized into a dataset group. The three dataset types supported by Personalize are items, users, and interactions. Depending on the recipe type you choose, a different combination of dataset types are required. For all recipe types, an interactions dataset is required. Interactions represent how users interact with items. For example, viewing a product, watching a video, listening to a recording, or reading an article. For this workshop, we will be using a recipe that supports all three dataset types.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we deployed the Retail Demo Store, it was deployed with an initial seed of fictitious User data as well as Offers. We will use this data to train a model, or solution, in the Amazon Personalize service which will be used to serve offer recommendations, related items,  and to rerank product lists for our users. The User and Product data can be accessed from the Retail Demo Store's Users and Offers microservices, respectively. We will access our data through microservice data APIs, process the data, and use it as the basis of a simualation of user-offer interactions.\n",
