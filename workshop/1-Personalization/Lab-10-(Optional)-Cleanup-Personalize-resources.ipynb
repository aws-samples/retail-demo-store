    "This notebook will walk through deleting all of the resources created by the Personalization Labs in this workshop. You should only need to perform these steps if you have deployed the Retail Demo Store in your own AWS account and want to deprovision the Personalize resources. If you are participating in an AWS-led workshop, this process is likely not necessary.\n",

In order, we will delete recommenders and campaigns, solutions, event trackers, filters, datasets, and the dataset group. In addition, we need to make sure that each resource type is fully deleted before moving on to the next resource type. We'll also delete the schemas for our datasets and reset the SSM parameter values that are used by the Recommendations service and Web UI for personalization features.\n",
