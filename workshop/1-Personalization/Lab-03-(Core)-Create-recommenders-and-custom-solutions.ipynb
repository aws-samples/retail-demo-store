    "## Lab 3 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will accomplish the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create retail domain recommenders for the following use cases:\n",
    "    - **Recommended For You**: will be used on the homepage (and other later workshops) to provide personalized recommendations for a given user. This recommender will be used for known users or warm anonymous users.\n",
    "    - **Popular Items by Views**: will be used on the homepage for new/cold anonymous users where no interaction history is available. Once a new/cold user has a few interactions (product views), the homepage will switch to the Recommended For You recommender.\n",
    "- Create custom solutions and solution versions for the following use cases:\n",
    "    - **Similar Items**: will be used on the product detail and \"live\" pages to display similar items to a given item.\n",
    "    - **Personalized-Ranking**: will be used to rerank featured products and search results.\n",
    "    - **Item Attribute Affinity**: user segmentation model that will be used in a later lab.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This lab should take about 70-90 minutes to complete. However, most of the time will be waiting for model training jobs to complete."
