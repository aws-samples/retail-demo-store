    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Retail Demo Store Personalization Workshop. In this module we're going to be implementing multiple personalization use cases, powered by [Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/), to enhance the base Retail Demo Store storefront. We will break up the process into multiple labs that are designed to progressively build on top of each other. Therefore, you should complete the labs in the order specified below. Some labs are optional, as indicated below.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional  labs\n",

    "\n",
    "Amazon Personalize makes it easy for customers to develop applications with a wide array of personalization use cases, including real time product recommendations and customized direct marketing. Amazon Personalize brings the same machine learning technology used by Amazon.com to everyone for use in their applications – with no machine learning experience required. Amazon Personalize customers pay for what they use, with no minimum fees or upfront commitment. You can start using Amazon Personalize with a simple three step process, which only takes a few clicks in the AWS console, or a set of simple API calls. First, point Amazon Personalize to user data, catalog data, and activity stream of views, clicks, purchases, etc. in Amazon S3 or upload using a simple API call. Second, with a single click in the console or an API call, train a custom private recommendation model for your data. Third, retrieve personalized recommendations for any user by creating a recommender or campaign, and using the GetRecommendations API.\n",

A recipe is a machine learning algorithm that you use with settings, or hyperparameters, and the data you provide to train an Amazon Personalize model. The data you provide to train a model are organized into separate datasets by the type of data being provided. A collection of datasets are organized into a dataset group. The three dataset types supported by Personalize are items, users, and interactions. Depending on the recipe type you choose, a different combination of dataset types are required. For all recipe types, an interactions dataset is required. Interactions represent how users interact with items. For example, viewing a product, watching a video, listening to a recording, or reading an article. For this workshop, we will be using a recipes that supports all three dataset types.\n",
