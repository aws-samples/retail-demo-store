    "Amazon Personalize provides predefined recipes, based on common use cases, for training models. A recipe is a machine learning algorithm that you use with settings, or hyperparameters, and the data you provide to train an Amazon Personalize model. The data you provide to train a model are organized into separate datasets by the type of data being provided. A collection of datasets are organized into a dataset group. The three dataset types supported by Personalize are items, users, and interactions. Depending on the recipe type you choose, a different combination of dataset types are required. For all recipe types, an interactions dataset is required. Interactions represent how users interact with items. For example, viewing a product, watching a video, listening to a recording, or reading an article. For this workshop, we will be using a recipe that supports all three dataset types.\n",

The User and Product data can be accessed from the Retail Demo Store's [Users](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/users) and [Products](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/products) microservices, respectively.

However, user intent often changes in real-time such that what products the user is interested in now may be different than what they were interested in a week ago, a day ago, or even a few minutes ago. Making recommendations that keep up with evolving user intent is one of the more difficult challenges with personalization. Fortunately, Amazon Personalize has a mechanism for this exact issue.\n",
