    "# Welcome to the Retail Demo Store Workshops\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshops in this project are designed to walk you through incrementally adding functionality to the base Retail Demo Store application. Some of the workshops build on each other so it is recommended to follow the workshops in order unless otherwise instructed as part of an organized event or workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT: The workshops are implemented using Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be executed from a SageMaker Notebook instance in an AWS account where the Retail Demo Store has been deployed. Therefore, the notebooks may not be fully functional outside AWS such as on your local machine. The Retail Demo Store's deployment templates will create the SageMaker Notebook instance and preload the workshop notebooks for you.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retail Demo Store Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Before opening and walking through the workshops, let's get familiar with the Retail Demo Store architecture and infrastructure deployed into your AWS account. Establishing this foundation will make the workshops more understandable and relatable back to the functionality being enhanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the Retail Demo Store is a polyglot microservice architecture deployed as a collection of RESTful web services in [Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (ECS). Several AWS managed services are leveraged to provide build, deployment, authentication, messaging, search, and personalization capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Retail Demo Store Architecture](./images/retaildemostore-architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Personalization, Messaging, Analytics, and AB Testing Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The Retail Demo Store provides personalized user experiences in the user interface using Amazon Personalize.  Amazon Pinpoint and Braze are integrated into the Retail Demo Store workshop environment to provide personalized email messaging capabilities via Amazon Personalize.  Amplitude is integrated to provide real-time user behavior analytics. Optimizely is used for feature flagging and AB testing Personalize models.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Retail Demo Store Personalization Architecture](./images/retail-demo-store-personalization-architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microservices\n",
    "\n",
    "The **[Users](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/users)**, **[Products](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/products)**, **[Carts](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/carts)**, and **[Orders](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/orders)** web services located in ECS rectangle in the above diagram provide access to retrieving and updating each respective entity type. These services are built with the [Golang](https://golang.org/) programming language and provide very basic implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **[Search](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/search)** service leverages [Amazon Elasticsearch](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/) to power user-entered product queries. The first workshop walks you through creating and populating the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **[Recommendations](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/recommendations)** service provides personalized user and related product recommendations and personalized ranking of products. In its default launch state, the service lacks the ability to provide personalization and instead provides default recommendations, such as featured products, from the **Products** service. The second workshop steps you through how to use [Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/) to add personalization capabilities in the Recommendations service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Application\n",
    "\n",
    "The **[Web Application](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/web-ui)** provides the user interface for the Retail Demo Store. It is built using the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript framework for UI components, [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to communicate with back-end web service APIs, and [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) to integrate with [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) for authentication, and [Amazon Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/) & [Amazon Personalize](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html) for capturing user behavior and clickstream data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Web Application is deployed to an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket and served to end-users using [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Services\n",
    "\n",
    "Retail Demo Store's microservices and workshops make extensive use of [AWS Cloud Map](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/) to discover the private addresses of other microservices and [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) to store and discover important system configuration values that effect how the services behave. For example, once the Amazon Personalize campaigns are built in the Personalization workshop, the ARNs are saved as SSM Parameters that the Recommendations microservice uses to retrieve recommendations from Personalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to explore these services in the AWS console as you work through the workshops to see how they're utilized by the Retail Demo Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build and Deployment Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Retail Demo Store uses [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) to automatically build and deploy the microservices and web application when a change is detected in the code repository (AWS CodeCommit or GitHub).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you deployed the Retail Demo Store via a linked GitHub repository (in which case you already have access to the source code in GitHub), you can view all source code for the Retail Demo Store's microservices and notebooks in the [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) Git repositories deployed in this AWS account. The full project is also available in the GitHub repository under aws-samples: [https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store).\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Interface Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Retail Demo Store project was deployed in your AWS account by CloudFormation, a CloudFront distribution was created that can be used to access the web application. The CloudFormation template provides the URL of the distribution as an Output parameter. Browse to the CloudFormation console in this AWS account, click on the Retail Demo Store's stack, then on the \"Outputs\" tab, and finally locate the key named \"WebURL\". Open this URL in a separate web browser tab/window.\n",
    "\n",
    "![CloudFormation Outputs](./images/cfn-webui-outputs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you access the WebURL you should see the Retail Demo Store home page.\n",
