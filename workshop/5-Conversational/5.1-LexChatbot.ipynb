    "# Retail Demo Store - Conversational AI Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Retail Demo Store Conversational AI Workshop. In this module we're going to implement a conversational chatbot using [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) and integrate it into the Retail Demo Store's web UI. We'll provide some basic functionality to our chatbot such as being able to provide a return policy to users as well as wiring up the chatbot to the Amazon Personalize ML models we created in the [Personalization](../1-Personalization/1.1-Personalize.ipynb) workshop to provide personalized product recommendations to our users. When you combine this workshop with the Personalization and [Messaging](../4-Messaging/4.1-Pinpoint.ipynb) workshops, you have a compelling example of how to deliver omnichannel personalization.\n",

It's important to emphasize that the `userId` provided by Lex is *NOT* the same user ID used in the Retail Demo Store. We need to map the user IDs somehow. The Retail Demo Store web app makes this possible by updating the user in the Users microservice with the entityId after the user signs in. This allows us to later map the EntityId to a user.\n",
