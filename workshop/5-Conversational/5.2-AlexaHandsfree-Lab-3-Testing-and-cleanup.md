# Testing & Usage

Using your Alexa device: 

Start the demo with this phrase:

           "Alexa, open Retail Demo Store" 

followed by: 

            “Where is the nearest store” 

## Pinpoint e-mail channel setup

### High-level concepts
Amazon Pinpint helps you engage with your customers by sending email, SMS, and push notification messages.  
The Retail Demo Store doesn't send an order confirmation email as part of the order service.  
Therefore, we can show how this can be implemented in our Alexa Skill Lambda function by integrating with Pinpoint.
The code is already integrated, all that is left to do is set-up an [email channel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/channels-email.html) within Amazon Pinpoint.

### Step-by-step Pinpoint setup
The instructions to setup a Pinpoint e-mail channel can be found within the [Pinpoint workshop](../4-Messaging/4.1-Pinpoint.ipynb) in the section "Enable Pinpoint Email Channel"

Once this has been completed, each time you checkout through the Alexa skill, an order confirmation email should be sent to the email address of the Retail Demo Store user setup through account linking.


# Deletion & Cleanup

Before deleting the Demo Store CloudFormation stack, the Cognito domain & App Client created 
in the **Cognito Authentication Setup** section must be manually deleted.

Resources owned by Retail Demo Store will be removed when the Retail Demo Store CloudFormation stack is removed - 
if you set the Alexa Skill ID and sandbox email parameters to empty and Update the stack, the backend Lambda will also
be removed.

You can remove your skill at [the Alexa developer UI](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).
